Reddit讨论：

Sometimes if MBTI comes up during the course of conversation, and I'm curious what that person's type is, I'll show them a quick 4-question MBTI test that I keep in my phone. It seems to be decent at typing people (since it cuts straight to the core of the traits themselves), though I suppose it does rely on a certain amount of self-awareness and honesty from people.

And yes, I realize that for all of you 'MBTI purists' out there, I'm sure the thought of a 4 question self-assessment is horrifying. But sometimes you're just having a quick conversation with someone & want to type them quickly (or try to get them to type themselves) & I've found this to be decent for those spontaneous moments.

Anyway, what are your thoughts on this quick 4-question test?

Instructions: For each question, which one describes you better.

Question 1: do you...

E: gain energy from being around people? OR

I: need to recharge from being around people?

Question 2: are you...

S: factual, detailed, live in the present? OR

N: a dreamer, fine with ambiguity, prefer theoretical / conceptual / abstract thoughts rather than precise details?

Question 3: do you...

T: make objective decisions regardless of how you feel about the situation; handle conflict ok? OR

F: make decisions based on your heart / your gut feel / how you feel; typically sensitive & caring; typically conflict-averse as well?

Question 4: are you...

J: a planner, organizer? OR

P: flexible, no plan - jump right to action - figure it out as you go?
